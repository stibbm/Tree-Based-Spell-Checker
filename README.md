# Tree-Based-Spell-Checker

Loads the words from a specified file into a dictionary that uses a tree structure to store the possible valid words. 

## Possible Extension

The model being used here to check whether a given word exists in the spell-check dictionary can also be easily modified to do word prediction when typing by providing the list of valid words that remain in the dictionary that start with the initial letters that you have typed in already.
